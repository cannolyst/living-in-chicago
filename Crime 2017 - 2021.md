## Crime in Chicago: 2017 to 2021

When I told people I was moving to Chicago after graduation, they all had one reaction: why would you move there when the crime is so bad? We have all heard it across the national news, from car jackings to robberies to the summer weekend shootings. So how bad was it when I was there? And what are we defining as bad?

To begin my search, I pulled the City of Chicago's chicago_crime dataset from BigQuery's public data. Here's what they define their data set as:

> This dataset reflects reported incidents of crime (with the exception of murders where data exists for each victim) that occurred in the City of Chicago from 2001 to present, minus the most recent seven days. Data is extracted from the Chicago Police Department's CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system. In order to protect the privacy of crime victims, addresses are shown at the block level only and specific locations are not identified.

>This data includes unverified reports supplied to the Police Department. The preliminary crime classifications may be changed at a later date based upon additional investigation and there is always the possibility of mechanical or human error. Therefore, the Chicago Police Department does not guarantee (either expressed or implied) the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, or correct sequencing of the information. The information should not be used for comparison purposes over time.

The table's schema is as follows: 

| Field name  | Type | Mode |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| unique_key | INTEGER  | REQUIRED |
| case_number | STRING | NULLABLE |
| date | TIMESTAMP  | NULLABLE |
| block  | STRING  | NULLABLE |
| iucr  | STRING  | NULLABLE |
| primary_type  | STRING  | NULLABLE |
| description | STRING  | NULLABLE |
| location_description  | STRING  | NULLABLE |
| arrest  | BOOLEAN  | NULLABLE |
| domestic  | BOOLEAN  | NULLABLE |
| beat  | INTEGER  | NULLABLE |
| district  | INTEGER  | NULLABLE |
| ward  | INTEGER  | NULLABLE |
| community_area  | INTEGER  | NULLABLE |
| fbi_code  | STRING  | NULLABLE |
| x_coordinate  | FLOAT  | NULLABLE |
| y_coordinate  | FLOAT | NULLABLE |
| year  | INTEGER  | NULLABLE |
| updated_on  | TIMESTAMP  | NULLABLE |
| latitude  | FLOAT  | NULLABLE |
| longitude  | FLOAT  | NULLABLE |
| location  | STRING  | NULLABLE |


Using BiqQuery, I set out to find how many entries there were from 2017 to 2021. 
```
SELECT*
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_crime.crime`
WHERE year >=2017 AND year <= 2022
```
This query returned over 1,326,414 results. Here are the first five rows of results.
