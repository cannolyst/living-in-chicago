# living-in-chicago
An analysis of data from from the years I lived in Chicago, 2017 to 2021. 

In March of 2017, I moved to Chicago from a small, rural town in Missouri. Everyone always had something to say about moving there, almost always related to the crime in the city. 

"There's so much crime there! They have gangs? Why do you want to live in a city that has gangs?"
"Do they only have deep dish pizza there?"

This project is an analysis of all sorts of data from Chicago - crime, pizza, maybe even hot dogs - from when I lived in the Windy City for four years using SQL and R with visualizations. Take a look!
